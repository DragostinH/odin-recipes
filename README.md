Hello
My first HTML project
I learned the basics of HTML, how to add headings, titles, links, images(and the different types of them)
Now on this project I'm excited to see what the task will be. I have not even read the whole thing. I had to look up the git commands again from a previous lesson since I hadn't remembered them. Hoepfully in the next project I won't need to do that. Now that I think about it, I will need to have this updated on GitHub and forgot the command about that as well.
